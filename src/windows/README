Windows Native Library for Java Implementation of Scrypt
========================================================

This directory (/src/windows) contains files needed to build a Windows
dynamic library to be loaded by JNI mechanism employed by the [Java
implementation of Scrypt](https://github.com/wg/scrypt).

Most of the codes are taken from
[https://github.com/barrysteyn/scrypt-windows], so all credits should 
go to Barry Steyn.

To build the dynamic loading library for Windows, JDK (1.7 or higher)
and Microsoft Windows SDK (tested with SDK 7.1) should be installed,
and JAVA_HOME should be set to the installed JDK, the Windows SDK's
Bin/ directory should be in PATH (we are calling setenv.bat from the
build script.) After you have the environment setup, simply double
click on the build.bat should do the trick. After a successful
building, you will get libscrypt32.dll and libscrypt64.dll in your
(project root)/target directory.

The scrypt-windows project contains 3 implementations of scrypt. In
this project, I picked the one with SSE optimization. If you want to
use the others, go to 
[https://github.com/barrysteyn/scrypt-windows/tree/master/scrypt-1.1.6/lib/crypto]
and pick one from crypto_scrypt-{ref,nosse,sse}.c to replace
c/crypto_scrypt-sse.c.
